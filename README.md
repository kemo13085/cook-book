I will be creating the HTML structure for a webpage for my Odin Project.
The webpage is about food recipes.
By the time I finish making this webpage, I expect to have demonstrated knowledge in the following:
The DOCTYPE declaration, the html tag, the head and body tag, some meta knowledge, images, paragraphs, headers, lists, and many more.
